# uttr

A macOS menu bar app for speech-to-text transcription. Press a hotkey, speak, and the transcribed text is automatically pasted at your cursor.

Runs locally using [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) with optional LLM post-processing.

## Features

- **Global hotkey** — Trigger recording from anywhere with a customizable shortcut
- **Local processing** — All transcription happens on your Mac, no cloud services
- **Auto-paste** — Transcribed text is pasted directly at your cursor
- **LLM post-processing** — Optional cleanup/formatting via local LLM (Ollama)
- **Menu bar app** — Stays out of your way, lives in the menu bar

## Installation

### Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
brew tap Rakk301/uttr
brew install --cask uttr
```
