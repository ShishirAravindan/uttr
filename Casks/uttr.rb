# Homebrew Cask formula for Uttr (SpeechToTextApp)
#
# To use this formula, you need to create a Homebrew tap:
#   1. Create a new GitHub repo named: homebrew-uttr
#   2. Copy this file to: Casks/uttr.rb in that repo
#   3. Users can then install via:
#      brew tap Rakk301/uttr
#      brew install --cask uttr
#
# Before publishing, update:
#   - version: Match your GitHub release tag (without 'v' prefix)
#   - sha256: Run `shasum -a 256 SpeechToTextApp.zip` on your release artifact

  caveats <<~EOS
    On first launch, you may need to allow the app in:
      System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway

    Grant these permissions when prompted:
      - Microphone access (for speech recording)
      - Accessibility access (for global hotkey and paste-at-cursor)
